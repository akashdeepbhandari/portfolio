# Akashdeep Portfolio

Creating this portfolio website involves following processes:

1. Wireframing: Created a layout of the website, focusing on the placement of key elements (header, navigation, content areas) without worrying about visual details.

2. Mockups: Design detailed visual mockups of this website, including color schemes, typography, and overall design elemetns. Used Adobe Xd to create these.

3. Development: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap code to bring the design to life. Ensure cross-browser compatibility and implement responsive design principles.

Challenges encountered in development:

Creating a design that responds well to different screen sizes and orientations was a challenging task. Achieving a responsive design that looks and functions flawlessly across all devices was challenging.To overcome this challenge, media queries and bootstrap were used in the accurate manner.

I have learned one major thing that, A web portfolio is a dynamic platform to showcase your projects, skills, and accomplishments. Whether you're an artist, designer, writer, developer, or any other professional, a portfolio allows you to demonstrate the quality and breadth of your work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
